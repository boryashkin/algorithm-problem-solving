# Longest Palindromic Substring

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

### Story
This problem took me a while to figure out.

Came up with first solution relatively quick, but it was too time consuming.

I've started to try new ways to solve this problem, but got stuck with uncertainty. 
Figured out that problem is in 2 types of palindromes: even and odd; And i need to find centers of palindromes. 
Tried to build something around that, but then decided to look up for existing solutions 
and find out that my idea looks like Manachers algorithm. But i didn't quite understand why i need to extend an initial string with #.
This way looks to hard to understand right away.
Then i dropped it off and implemented another way, but still near n squared time.
